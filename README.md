The main objective  is to assist an anesthetist during surgery in reducing human
error when administering the right dosage of anesthesia medication to the patient. 
The keypad interface allows the patient to select the desired level of anesthesia in terms 
of milliliters (1 milliliter to 1000 milliliters) and the optimal injection time. LCD stands for
interfaced to show the dosage to be administered and the recommended injection 
time introduced. The current time is tracked by a real-time clock. Mechanically, a stepper
 motor consistent flow of anesthesia at the proper time using an infusion pump that is
 attached to the syringe.
